            <p>I learned how to replicate how the PupilPath website looks using HTML and CSS.</p>

            <a href="https://repl.it/@graced2739/copycat-website#index.html">Code of the Website</a><br>
            <p>I did this project to strengthen my skill and usage of CSS and HTML. One challenge I came across was using the image of the PupilPath logo and resizing it, it was a hassle for me because as I was trying to resize it, for some reason my code didn't work when I ran it so instead I just used another font as the PupilPath logo. Even though I did that I could've had more patience in resizing the actual logo rather than just using a font that is noticeably different from the font of the actual Pupilpath. Another problem that came up was the code that lets an underline appear under certain words when your mouse hovers above it. For CaseNEX/Datacation an underline should appear under CaseNEX and another should appear under Datacation but it didn't and instead an underline was under CaseNEX/Datacation when you hover on it. I didn't fix it which I can definitely reflect on as I could've ask for help or tried longer to fix my code. It was also hard to see the underline sometimes for the Parent Register and the Student Register which I can once again tried longer or ask someone for help. So now after finishing this project I will definitely take my mistakes in account and work harder and ask questions when I need to during my future projects.
